          <h2>Haptic Glove with Oculus, Unity and Arduino </h2>
          <p>
            This project was done with a team of four students for Penn Engineering Senior Design. We set out to create a haptic glove that could integrate with an Oculus
            and offer a user a sense of realistic touch in virtual reality. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Problem and Need</b> <br>
            Science fiction authors and technology enthusiasts have long dreamed of a fully-immersive virtual world where senses like sight and touch are so realistic 
            that users cannot differentiate feeling from reality. Modern virtual reality headsets realistically trick our sense of sight to perceive virtual worlds. 
            However, gloves aiming to replicate touch lag far behind. Problems with currently available haptic gloves include weight, size, cost, and immersiveness. 
            Most designs use large and heavy servo motors that tug at your fingers and cost upwards of $10,000 without adequately replicating touch or requiring you to 
            fix your arms in place. A significant amount of research and development into haptics stems from the gaming industry, where use cases are dynamic and 
            intense, but the stakes for accuracy are low compared to other industries like remote surgery. This makes the gaming industry the perfect sandbox to 
            explore alternative designs to improve haptic gloves. We are building a haptic glove with a unique blend of vibration motors and electrostatic brakes 
            that is sleeker, lighter, cheaper, and more immersive for gamers.          
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Value Proposition</b> <br>
            Our haptic design leverages two key technologies that collectively capture all forms of haptic feedback necessary for a robust and immersive haptic system. 
            Primarily, we implement tiny vibration motors across the hand that are connected to a microcontroller and vibrate in short bursts when touch is initiated 
            to deliver low latency feedback. Secondly, we implement an electrostatic brake using thin metal plates across the hand that clamp together when a voltage 
            is applied. These metal plates restrict the hand from closing completely when grabbing objects in the virtual world, similar to how an object you grab in 
            the real world applies a force back on your hand keeping your hand from closing completely. These two technologies combined allow us to deliver realistic 
            haptic feedback at a lower price point and lighter weight than more involved systems that require servos. The idea behind this design came out of a lab at 
            Carnegie Mellon, however our novel material selection for the dielectric and coating enables us to make the design commercially viable and consumer friendly
             by delivering the same lab performance with safe power limits.          
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Hardware Design</b> <br>
            Our final haptic glove integrates two types of haptic feedback: tactile feedback and structural force feedback. We implement tactile feedback using 
            piezoelectric actuators, or simply put, vibration motors. Tactile feedback is the light sensation of touch, similar to touching a tabletop or pushing a 
            button. As shown on the right in Figure 01, the vibration motors are placed at the users fingertips and would be activated when the user touches a virtual 
            object. Structural feedback is the sensation of gripping an object and feeling the force resist your hands/fingers from moving completely freely, such as 
            gripping a pencil, water bottle, ball or any other object. We accomplish structural force feedback through the innovation of the electrostatic clutch. When 
            activated, the clutch restricts the user from further closing their grip. Even though Figure 01 only displays the clutch on a single finger, the final 
            product would include a clutch on each finger, restricting movement in five DOF (degrees of freedom).           
          </p>
          <img src="assets/img/portfolio/glove_architecture.png" alt="" width="300">
          <p> </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/glove_back.jpg" alt="" width="300">
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/glove_front.jpg" alt="" width="300">
            </div>
          </div>
          <p> </p>
          <p>
            Finally, both of these haptic systems are integrated in the software such that the piezoelectric actuators are activated for 300 milliseconds each time a 
            finger collides with an object in the virtual world. The piezoelectric actuators have a very low latency. Hence, by activating them first for a short 
            duration, before the clutch is able to fully engage, we are able to reduce latency and ensure immersion.
          </p>
            <b>Software Design</b> <br>
            There were two elements of the software stack we needed to pursue: 1) processing signals within the Oculus environment to see when the hand needed to 
            receive force feedback and 2) sending signals from the headset to the glove. As a result, we had two main workstreams: Unity (C#) and Arduino (C++). 
            On the Unity side, we wanted to implement a system which reacted when two separate actions occurred in our virtual environment. This required implementing 
            event listeners and setting the game physics to trigger them under the right stimuli. The Oculus hand tracking API streamlined the process of finding which 
            joints were where in physical space and made the process of detecting important collisions much easier. When events were registered, the Unity environment 
            would send signals to the gloveâ€™s ESP32 microcontroller over a UART connection. (It was in our plans for March to switch this wired testing environment to 
            a wireless one operating over a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection, but unfortunately this part of the project got cut short.) The ESP32 was then 
            programmed to send the proper signals to both the piezoelectric actuators and electrostatic clutches.

            Overall, we are proud of the technical progress we made during the year. 
            We were able to create a final integrated system that implemented both electrostatic clutches and piezoelectric actuators. 
            This hardware system was wrapped by a custom software solution integrating with the Oculus Quest and their hand tracking system.
